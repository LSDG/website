        <h1>We develop software!</h1>
        <p class="lead">That's right! As the name implies, we're a group of developers, in Lubbock TX, who get together once a month to share ideas, and technology. It's the first Thursday, of every month, @ 6:30pm <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/YOH7s">here</a>.</p>

            <p>We are huge fans of all technology. Everything from .Net to Node.js to Erlang, there's someone in the group who knows and loves it. We also believe in open-source, and all of our projects are available on Github. Feel free to browse and fork away.</p>

            <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Christmas Lights</h2>
            <p>Every year, we put up a Christmas Lights show, using a Raspberry Pi arm computer, and a microcontroller. People can drive by, and watch the lights as they blink to music we broadcast over a small radio transmitter. The show is entirely free, and volunteer.</p>
