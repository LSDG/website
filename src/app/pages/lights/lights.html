    <h2><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Christmas Light Show</h2>

    <p>Every year, we get together to setup a christmas lights display at the Family Counseling Services center. The show is free; and done entirely as a volunteer effort. It's a great way for us to give back to the community, and do what we do best: <i>develop things.</i></p>

    <h4>Not your Grandma's Christmas Lights</h4>
    <p>You see, being the kind of people we are, we weren't happy with just putting up some pretty lights. Instead, we designed a system using <b>32</b> strings of lights, controlled by an <a href="http://arduino.cc/">Arduino micocontroller</a>, talking to a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> arm computer, connecting over the internet to a website running <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, and transmitting sound over a radio transmitter.
        The Raspberry Pi performs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">Fast Fourier Analysis</a> on the songs, and figured out how to blink the lights to the music. You can connect to the website, request a couple of songs to hear next from the list of available songs. The site then sends that over the internet to the little Raspberry Pi, and it plays that song next.</p>

    <h4>That sounds Crazy!</h4>
    <p>I know!</p>

    <h4>Why do all this?</h4>
    <p>The most honest answer is, "because we can". But, really, it's a fun project that allows us to learn a lot about technologies we wouldn't otherwise use, it looks <i>awesome</i>, and it creates something unique. As far as we can tell, even those impressive lightshows you see on youtube don't do it this way. And every year, ours gets better and better.</p>
    <p>So, why don't you come by and check it out? Once you see it, I'm sure you'll understand why we wanted to do something this cool.</p>
